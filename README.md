# HodgkinHoxleyModel
MATLAB Implementation of Hodgkin-Hoxley Model of Neuron.
Generate a spike and Gating variables of the neuron with Hodgkin-Hoxley model of neuron.
Just write this command on your command window: answer= hodgkinHoxley();
Then you have a matrix of answer=[t,v,n,m,h] including Time, Voltage of membrane, n variable, m variable, and h variable respectively.
